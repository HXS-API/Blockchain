# Blockchain Project

HXS (Humanitarian Exchange Server) is an open source initiative launched by [Beehive](https://beehive.ngo) volunteers bringing humanitarian organizations, tech volunteers and supporters together to setup an enterprise-grade IATI database, server and API for developers to use to prototype, test power and scale next-generation IATI-data-driven applications.

**IATI** is a technical framework managed by the [International Aid Transparency Initiative](http://iatistandard.org) that the humanitarian community has been working concertedly to setup and broadly mandate. The framework provides organizations and donors with a channel to openly share and compare detailed information on aid activities, transactions and results and make the information accessible to machine applications.

## Humanitarian Blockchain Research

HXS is studying how to setup and power a distributed IATI data sharing network to help engineer an API capable of supporting conventional and non-conventional applications, including IATI compliant blockchain networks, nodes and user interfaces.

## IATI Blockchain 1.0

To get started, volunteers are building a rudamentary and largely simulated IATI blockchain network and a user interface to serve node users.
